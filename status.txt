Status file. This file just contains what I need to do next for this project:

1. Connect parallel cables from ov7670 to MCU, supply 3v3 line and xClk with clock signal
2. Test to see if the href and vsync pins come alive along with the parallel lines.
3. Figure out next steps for SCCB interface to the ov7670 and if i2c (or tweaked i2c) will be enough to talk to it
